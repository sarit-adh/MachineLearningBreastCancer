Dataset

Breast Cancer Wisconsin (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
ID number, diagnosis, and 10 features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area,  smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points,  symmetry, fractal dimension.

Machine Learning Tasks

Training Classification Model
We plan to use 4 classification algorithms as mentioned in ‘techniques’ subsection to train the model

Cross Validation
Cross validation will be performed for hyperparameter tuning. For e.g. K-Nearest Neighbor models are prepared with different values of K and the best one is selected using LOOCV

Performance Evaluation
We will run classification using the best models (based on LOOCV) from 4 training algorithms on test set. We will construct confusion matrix for each of them and calculate precision, recall and f-score for comparison of the algorithms.

Techniques
Support Vector Machine
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbor
Logistic Regression
